# Apps

##School Information System (SIS)
This tracks the studentsâ€™ information and their parent/guardian/contact information. This module also records, basic classes information, and school year information. This is the central module for django-scms and is required for use of any other module. All other modules are optional.

##Admissions
This tracks potential students and their registration processes. It allows various admission levels to be added as well as steps that need to be completed before moving onto the next level. It also tracks any open houses a student has attended and how the student heard about the school.
